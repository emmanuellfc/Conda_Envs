# Conda Environment for Google Colab.


The tricky part here is to know what is the correct version that you need to install
in order to have a proper installation of HOOMD, that's the whole issue.
I'm assuming that you can use a terminal in the Colab Environment.
1. First you have to mount your Google account, this is done in the notebook via
    `from google.colab import drive\\
    drive.mount('/content/drive')`
